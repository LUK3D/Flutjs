/** Overrides the default values of visual properties for descendant
* [AppBar] widgets.
*
* Descendant widgets obtain the current [AppBarTheme] object with
* `AppBarTheme.of(context)`. Instances of [AppBarTheme] can be customized
* with [AppBarTheme.copyWith].
*
* Typically an [AppBarTheme] is specified as part of the overall [Theme] with
* [ThemeData.appBarTheme].
*
* All [AppBarTheme] properties are `null` by default. When null, the [AppBar]
* compute its own default values, typically based on the overall theme's
* [ThemeData.colorScheme], [ThemeData.textTheme], and [ThemeData.iconTheme].
